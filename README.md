# w-rite

w-rite is a webapp that allows everyone to write any text while they're browsing.

Currently to use w-rite, you need first to login with your google account (In the future, federated authentication will be implemented). Once, you're logged in, you can write (even draw) any text. Your text will be stored and displayed personally according to your login-account.

w-rite uses google.appengine technology:
  - jinja2 template
  - Google Login
